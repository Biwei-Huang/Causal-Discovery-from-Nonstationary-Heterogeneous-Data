- indtest_new: WRAPPER performing KCI-test, the conditional independence testing method submitted to UAI 2011;

- UInd_KCItest: function to perform unconditional independence testing given in our paper; it is theoretically equiavalent to Gretton et al. (2008) but is computationally easier when generating the null distribution with simulations.

- indtest_corr: partial correlation test;

- indtest_hsic: WRAPPER performing either an HSIC test (Gretton et al., 2008) or CI_PERM


DIRECTORIES:
- algorithms: contains the functions which are called by the conditional independence testing method or the PC algorithm;

- exp: contains the files used in simulations and experiments;

- data: contains the real-world data used in the experiments.

- CI_PERM: contains the functions which are used in CI_PERM, the conditional independence testing method which combines the conditional dependence measure (Fukumizu et al., 2008) and local boostrapping.

- gpml-matlab: the gpml toolbox.
