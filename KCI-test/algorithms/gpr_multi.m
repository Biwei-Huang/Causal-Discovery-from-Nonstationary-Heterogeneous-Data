% of vectors on which we do repression from x

% gpr - Gaussian process regression, with a named covariance function. Two
% modes are possible: training and prediction: if no test data are given, the
% function returns minus the log likelihood and its partial derivatives with
% respect to the hyperparameters; this mode is used to fit the hyperparameters.
% If test data are given, then (marginal) Gaussian predictions are computed,
% whose mean and variance are returned. Note that in cases where the covariance
% function has noise contributions, the variance returned in S2 is for noisy
% test targets; if you want the variance of the noise-free latent function, you
% must substract the noise variance.
%
% usage: [nlml dnlml] = gpr(logtheta, covfunc, x, y)
%    or: [mu S2]  = gpr(logtheta, covfunc, x, y, xstar)
%
% where:
%
%   logtheta is a (column) vector of log hyperparameters
%   covfunc  is the covariance function
%   x        is a n by D matrix of training inputs
%   y        is a (column) vector (of size n) of targets
%   xstar    is a nn by D matrix of test inputs
%   nlml     is the returned value of the negative log marginal likelihood
%   dnlml    is a (column) vector of partial derivatives of the negative
%                 log marginal likelihood wrt each log hyperparameter
%   mu       is a (column) vector (of size nn) of prediced means
%   S2       is a (column) vector (of size nn) of predicted variances
