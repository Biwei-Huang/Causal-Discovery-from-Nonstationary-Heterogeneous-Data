IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
function [gns, g, SP] = nonsta_cd_new(X,cond_ind_test,maxFanIn,alpha)
%  Constraint-based causal Discovery from Nonstationary/heterogeneous Data

% INPUT: 
%       Data: - T*n matrix. T is number of data points and n is the number
%               of observed variables
%       cond_ind_test: - function handle that computes p-values for X ind. Y given Z: 
%                 (p_val = cond_ind_test(X, Y, Z, pars))
%       maxFanIn:  - maximum number of variables in the conditioning set 
%       alpha: - significance level of the independence test

% OUTPUT:
%       gns: - (n+1)*(n+1) matrix to represent recovered graph structure by
%       the methods for Markov equivalence class learning on augmented
%       causal graph & causal direction determination by making use of
%       independently changing causal modules
%            i->j: gns(i,j)=1; i-j: gns(i,j)=-1; i j: gns(i,j)=0
%          - the last row of gns indicates the connection of nonstationarity
%            indicator (C) with other observed variables
%       g: - (n+1)*(n+1) matrix to represent recovered graph structure only by
%       the methods for Markov equivalence class learning on augmented
%       causal graph
%            i->j: g(i,j)=1; i-j: g(i,j)=-1; i j: g(i,j)=0
%          - the last row of g indicates the connection of nonstationarity
%            indicator (C) with other observed variables
%       ("gns" should have more oriented edges than "g")
%       SP: - details of each independence test
